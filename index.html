		<b>RBAtools</b> is a programming interface for <a href="https://rba.inrae.fr">Resource Balance Analysis</a> (RBA) models.
		It includes methods to solve, modify, and analyse RBA models and to export model information and simulation results into various formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further information and tutorials can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/rbatools">GitHub</a> page
	</p>

	<h4>Linear solver support:</h4>
	<p>
		<b>RBAtools</b> is based on linear-programming and therefore requires a linear-optimization package. 
		We strongly suggest using the (propriatary) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer">CPLEX</a> tool, which is available under a free academic license.

		Nonetheless we included functionality with the freely available <a href="https://github.com/biosustain/swiglpk">swiglpk</a> solver, however this sometimes is not able to obtain satisfactory solutions.
	</p>

	<h4>Online tutorial:</h4>
	<p>
		An <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/obodeit/rbatools_mybinder/main?labpath=tutorial_mybinder.ipynb">online tutorial</a> is available via <a href="https://mybinder.org">Binder</a>
	</p>

	<h4>Model availability:</h4>
	<p>
		RBA models have already been developed for:
		<ul>
			<li> <i>Bacillus subtilis 168 (wild type)</i> </li>
			<li> <i>Escherichia coli K-12 (wild type)</i> </li>
			<li> <i>CO2-fixing Escherichia coli K-12 (engineered strain)</i> </li>
		</ul>
