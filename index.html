		RBAtools is a Python programming interface for the <a href="https://rba.inrae.fr">Resource Balance Analysis</a> (RBA) framework.
		It includes methods to solve, modify, and analyse RBA models and to export model information and simulation results into various formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further information and tutorials can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/rbatools">GitHub</a> page
	</p>

	<h4 id="sec1"><b>Linear solver support:</b></h4>
	<p>
		RBAtools is based on linear-programming and therefore requires a linear optimization package. 
		We strongly suggest using the (proprietary) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer">CPLEX</a> tool, which is available under a free academic license.

		Nonetheless we included functionality with the freely available <a href="https://github.com/biosustain/swiglpk">swiglpk</a> solver, however this sometimes is not able to obtain satisfactory solutions.
	</p>

	<h4 id="sec2"><b>Installation:</b></h4>

	<p>
		<b>Install this package locally:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		After cloning this repository, in your terminal navigate into the base directory of rbatools locally on your computer and execute:
	</p>
    <code>pip install .</code>

	<p>
		<b>Install this package from PyPI:</b>
	</p>

    <code>pip install rbatools</code>

	<h4 id="sec3"><b>Command line tool:</b></h4>

	<p>
		When installing the rbatools library, command line tools for basic applications are co-installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>run-growth-rate-optimization</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool runs a growth-rate optimisation and stores the obtained results as sbtab.
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional arguments for the used lp-solver (default: swiglpk, alternative: cplex) and the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>run-growth-rate-optimization path/to/rba/model --lp-solver swiglpk --output-dir dedicated/location/of/results</code>
	<p>
		<b>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool imports an rba-model and exports its component-structure as tabular sbtab (as presented on https://rba.inrae.fr/models)
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional argument for the path where the results should be stored.
		To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html path/to/rba/model --output-dir dedicated/location/of/results</code>

	<h4 id="sec4"><b>Online tutorial:</b></h4>
	<p>
		We generated a <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/obodeit/rbatools_mybinder/main?labpath=tutorial_mybinder.ipynb">short tutorial</a> to be accessed online (without any local installations/requirements), hosted by <a href="https://mybinder.org">Binder</a>.
	</p>

	<h4 id="sec5"><b>Tutorials:</b></h4>
	<p>
	Our repository includes various instructional jupyter notebooks, exemplifying the use of rbatools.
	</p>

	<h4 id="sec6"><b>Model availability:</b></h4>
	<p>
		RBA models have already been developed for:
		<ul>
			<li> <i>Bacillus subtilis 168 (wild type)</i> </li>
			<li> <i>Escherichia coli K-12 (wild type)</i> </li>
			<li> <i>CO2-fixing Escherichia coli K-12 (engineered strain)</i> </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models">You can access these models here</a>.
