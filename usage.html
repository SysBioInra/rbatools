	RBAtools is a Python library, which can be imported and used in scripts and other applications.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore we provide selected standard workflows as scripts and command line tools, to be used from one's terminal.
</p>
<p>
	To exemplify the capabilities, give inspirations for applications and introduce the user to working with RBAtools, we created extensive Jupyter notebooks as intructional tutorials.
</p>
		
<h4 id="sec1"><b>Tutorial Jupyter notebooks:</b></h4>
<p>
	Our <a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/rbatools">repository</a> includes various instructional jupyter notebooks, exemplifying the use of rbatools.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the Jupyter notebooks require additional dependencies, not co-installed with rbatools.
</p>
<p>
  Those can be installed with the following commands:
</p>
<p>
  <code>pip install notebook</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>pip install ipywidgets</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>pip install matplotlib</code>
</p>
<p>
  <code>pip install seaborn</code>
</p>
<h5>Example_workflows_rba_tools.ipynb:</h5>
<p>
	This is a Jupyter notebook with example applications and workflows of rbatools with B.subtilis model.
</p>
<h5>Model_components_information_access.ipynb:</h5>
<p>
	This is a Jupyter notebook with example applications on how to access information on model-components and their relationships in the B.subtilis model.
</p>
<h5>Example_workflows_rba_tools_Ecoli.ipynb:</h5>
<p>
	Example applications and workflows with E.coli model. (Please note significantly longer computation times, than with B.subtilis model)
</p>

<h4 id="sec2"><b>Import as library in Python:</b></h4>
<p>
When used in own Python code, RBAtools can be imported as follows:
</p>

<code>import rbatools</code>

<p>
  For instructions on usage, please refer to our <a href="usage.html#sec4">tutorials</a> and <a href="api_ref.html">API reference</a>.
</p>
  
<h4 id="sec3"><b>Command line interface:</b></h4>

	<p>
		When installing the rbatools library, command line tools for basic applications are co-installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>run-growth-rate-optimization</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool runs a growth-rate optimisation and stores the obtained results as sbtab.
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional arguments for the used lp-solver (default: swiglpk, alternative: cplex) and the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>run-growth-rate-optimization path/to/rba/model --lp-solver swiglpk --output-dir ...</code>
	<p>
		<b>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool imports an rba-model and exports its component-structure as tabular sbtab (as presented on https://rba.inrae.fr/models)
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional argument for the path where the results should be stored.
		To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html path/to/rba/model --output-dir ...</code>

<h4 id="sec4"><b>Scripts:</b></h4>
<p>
We provided scripts with basic functionalities of rbatools in the subdirectory "scripts":
</p>
<p>
<b>run_growth_rate_optimization.py:</b>

This script runs a growth-rate optimisation and stores the obtained results as sbtab. The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional arguments for the used lp-solver (default: swiglpk, alternative: cplex) and the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
</p>

<code>python run_growth_rate_optimization.py path/to/model --lp-solver swiglpk --output-dir ...</code>

<p>
	<b>generate_sbtab_of_model_for_html.py:</b>

This script imports an rba-model and exports its component-structure as tabular sbtab (as presented on https://rba.inrae.fr/models) The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional argument for the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
</p>

<code>python generate_sbtab_of_model_for_html.py path/to/model --output-dir ...</code>
