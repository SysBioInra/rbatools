<h4 id="sec1"><b>Import as library in Python:</b></h4>
<p>
When used in own Python code, RBAtools can be imported as follows:
</p>

<code>import rbatools</code>

<h4 id="sec2"><b>Scripts:</b></h4>
<p>
We provided scripts with basic functionalities of rbatools in the subdirectory "scripts":
</p>
<p>
<b>run_growth_rate_optimization.py:</b>

This script runs a growth-rate optimisation and stores the obtained results as sbtab. The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional arguments for the used lp-solver (default: swiglpk) and the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
</p>

<code>python run_growth_rate_optimization.py path/to/model --lp-solver SOLVER_OF_CHOICE --output-dir ...</code>

<p>
	<b>generate_sbtab_of_model_for_html.py:</b>

This script imports an rba-model and exports its component-structure as tabular sbtab (as presented on https://rba.inrae.fr/models) The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional argument for the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
</p>

<code>python generate_sbtab_of_model_for_html.py path/to/model --output-dir ...</code>
	
<h4 id="sec3"><b>Command line interface:</b></h4>

	<p>
		When installing the rbatools library, command line tools for basic applications are co-installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>run-growth-rate-optimization</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool runs a growth-rate optimisation and stores the obtained results as sbtab.
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional arguments for the used lp-solver (default: swiglpk, alternative: cplex) and the path where the results should be stored. To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>run-growth-rate-optimization path/to/rba/model --lp-solver swiglpk --output-dir dedicated/location/of/results</code>
	<p>
		<b>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This tool imports an rba-model and exports its component-structure as tabular sbtab (as presented on https://rba.inrae.fr/models)
		The arguments to provide are an rba-model and the optional argument for the path where the results should be stored.
		To run it, execute the following command in your terminal:
	</p>
	<code>generate-sbtab-of-model-for-html path/to/rba/model --output-dir dedicated/location/of/results</code>

<h4 id="sec4"><b>Instructional Jupyter notebooks:</b></h4>
<p>
	Our <a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/rbatools">repository</a> includes various instructional jupyter notebooks, exemplifying the use of rbatools.
